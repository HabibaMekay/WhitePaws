1- Problem Definition

Maintaining an animal shelter is not an easy job, and it requires a lot of data storing daily. It is not common to see websites that are related to sheltering animals and encouraging their adoption, which could be part of the reason why one could often find injured and starved stray animals.
For that reason, we find it necessary to create a database for this information. The website will help the adopters and donators easily choose their pets and donate, not only that, but it will allow the shelter employees to know their schedules, and keep up with the suppliers, and have a history of the animal's medical status.
